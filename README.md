## 🐍 Python-intermediate

- Chapters 14, 15, 16... from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Moves beyond basic syntax and into how the language is often used in the real world, including:
    * Reading/ writing to CSV/ JSON/ Excel documents
    * Use of Juypter Notebook to visualize data analysis
    * Numerical and image manipulation with Numpy
    * 


## 💭 Thoughts so far

- These chapters move beyond the simple benefit of "Python is easy to read and write" and move into the main utilities of the language
- It's immediately very clear to see why this language is so extensively used in data/ automation heavy use cases
- There seems to be a library for every possible use case
