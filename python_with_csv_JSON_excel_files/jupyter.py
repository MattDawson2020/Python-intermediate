# jupyter notebook in terminal to open directory in juypter, it seems to work as a front end visualiser for data analysis tools

# loading CSV and json files
# df1=pandas.read_csv("data/supermarkets.csv")
# df1

#this can be used to open a CSV file in a much more readable format in jupyter browser
# read_json can do the same with json files

#excel files 
# requires openpyxl and xlrd libraries
#works very similar just use df3=pandas.read_excel("data/supermarkets.xlsx", sheet_name=0)
#sheetname is an optional argument but is a good idea for readability
